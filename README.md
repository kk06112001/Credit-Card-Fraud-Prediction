This repository focuses on detecting credit card fraud using a dataset with transformed features derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to predict fraudulent transactions based on the available numerical features. Since the dataset only provides transformed components, no additional background information or original features can be disclosed due to confidentiality issues.
The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate various classification models for detecting credit card fraud. Using PCA-transformed features along with Time and Amount, the models are trained to accurately classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. This is important for financial institutions looking to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, thereby reducing potential financial losses.
